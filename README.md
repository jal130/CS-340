  How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the   dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Creating programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be acheived by focusing heavily on ecapsulation and abstraction. Writing code this way produces results that are easily portable and adaptable since a small change to the individual class will affect every time that class is used throuought the code. The crud python module can be used for any application that needs to create, read, update, or delete records in a database.  

  How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach    to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach problems as a computer scientist by breaking down the problem into smaller parts and then planning a way to solve each part of the problem. This approch is used for pretty much any problem I face. More complex problems will require more tasks to complete, but the same apprach can be applied to small problems as well. In the future, I would ask clients for their needs and then plan a way to meet those needs. 


  What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
A computer scientist uses computer code to solve problems efficiently. This type of work provides value to companies by being able to process large amounts of data vastly more efficiently and quickly than it could be done with human calculations.
